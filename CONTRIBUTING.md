## 📁 Folder Structure Guidelines

Please keep content organized in the appropriate folders:

- `learning-materials/` — Educational content grouped by domain (frontend, backend, DevOps, etc.).
- `interview-tasks/` — Practice or real-world tasks grouped by role or stack.
- `leetcode/` — Solved LeetCode problems, sorted by difficulty: `easy/`, `medium/`, `hard/`.
- `bookmarks/` — External resources grouped by platform or content type.
- `tools-and-snippets/` — Developer tools, extensions, commands, and code snippets.

## 📝 Markdown & Formatting Rules

- Use `.md` files and standard [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
- When adding a link, include a brief description. For example:

<pre>
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) – Comprehensive reference for web developers.
</pre>

- Avoid duplicate entries — check existing content before adding new links.
- Keep file and folder names lowercase using `kebab-case` (e.g., `vs-code-tools.md`).
- Prefer English for all content and commit messages.
